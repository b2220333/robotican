This package includes user interface which allows to monitor robotican robots sensors
easily. The interface include leds which will be turned on once the sensor associated 
with it is publishing a message on the topic that was defined.

Instructions:
Robotican_GUI pulling topics names from ros-master parameters system.
Therefore the user must make sure that ros-master is up with the sutable configuration.
If GUI will not recognise the topic parameters in ros master it will listen to default topics.

the following list describes default topic and ros-param name (ment to be customised by user) for each sensor:
*********************************************
sensor name |   ros-param	    |	default topic
*********************************************
Gripper		    gripper_topic	    gripper_controller/gripper_cmd/status
Arm			    arm_topic		    arm_trajectory_controller/state
PanTilt		    pan_tilt_topic	    pan_tilt_controller/command
GPS			    gps_topic		    GPS/fix
IMU			    imu_topic		    IMU/data
Rear cam	    rear_cam_topic	    rear_camera/image_raw
Front cam	    front_cam_topic	    front_camera/image_raw
Left URF	    urf_left_topic	    URF/left
Right URF	    urf_right_topic	    URF/right
Rear URF	    urf_rear_topic	    URF/rear
LIDAR		    lidar_topic		    scan
Odometry	    odom_topic		    mobile_base_controller/odom
Battery		    battery_topic	    *NOT IMPLEMENTED YET*

User can also determine led's label names, by setting the following ros params on master server:
*************************************
label param name    |   default value
*************************************
battery_lbl_name        BATTERY
gps_lbl_name            GPS
imu_lbl_name            IMU
lidar_lbl_name          LIDAR
odom_lbl_name           ODOM
arm_lbl_name            ARM
gripper_lbl_name        GRIPPER
left_urf_lbl_name       LEFT
right_urf_lbl_name      RIGHT
rear_urf_lbl_name       REAR
kinect2_lbl_name        KINECT2
f200_lbl_name           F200
rear_cam_lbl_name       REAR
front_cam_name          FRONT
pan_tilt_name           PAN-TILT

Also, user is expected to set the launcher file and package name. Values are:
*****************************
ros-param           |   default value
*****************************
launcher_file_path	    armadillo.launch
launcher_file_pkg	    robotican_armadillo
